## AI-SDK Integration Specification

### Report Generation Implementation

The report generation feature will use the ai-sdk package to process session data and generate professional reports.

#### Integration Setup

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "ai-sdk";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
```

#### Example Prompt Structure

```typescript
const generateSessionReport = async (sessionData) => {
  const {
    client,
    sessionInfo,
    skillAcquisition,
    behaviors,
    reinforcers,
    notes,
  } = sessionData;

  const prompt = `
    Generate a professional ABA therapy session report based on the following data:
    
    CLIENT INFORMATION:
    Name: ${client.firstName} ${client.lastName}
    Age: ${client.age}
    
    SESSION INFORMATION:
    Date: ${sessionInfo.date}
    Duration: ${sessionInfo.startTime} to ${sessionInfo.endTime}
    Location: ${sessionInfo.location}
    
    SKILL ACQUISITION PROGRAMS:
    ${formatSkillAcquisitionForPrompt(skillAcquisition)}
    
    BEHAVIORS OBSERVED:
    ${formatBehaviorsForPrompt(behaviors)}
    
    REINFORCERS USED:
    ${formatReinforcersForPrompt(reinforcers)}
    
    ADDITIONAL NOTES:
    ${notes.generalNotes}
    
    Generate a comprehensive session report following this structure:
    1. Session Overview
    2. Skill Acquisition Summary
    3. Behavior Analysis
    4. Reinforcement Effectiveness
    5. Recommendations
    
    Use professional clinical language appropriate for behavioral health documentation.
  `;

  const response = await openai.complete({
    model: "gpt-4",
    prompt,
    max_tokens: 1000,
  });

  return response.text;
};
```

#### Data Formatting Helper Functions

```typescript
const formatSkillAcquisitionForPrompt = (skillPrograms) => {
  return skillPrograms
    .map(
      (program) =>
        `Program: ${program.name}
     Target: ${program.target}
     Prompt Level: ${program.promptLevel}
     Response: ${program.responseType}
     Trials: ${program.trialsSuccessful}/${program.trialsTotal}
     Notes: ${program.notes}`
    )
    .join("\n\n");
};

const formatBehaviorsForPrompt = (behaviors) => {
  return behaviors
    .map(
      (behavior) =>
        `Behavior: ${behavior.type}
     ${
       behavior.measurementType === "frequency"
         ? `Frequency: ${behavior.value} occurrences`
         : ""
     }
     ${
       behavior.measurementType === "duration"
         ? `Duration: ${behavior.value} seconds`
         : ""
     }
     ${
       behavior.measurementType === "intensity"
         ? `Intensity: ${behavior.value}/5`
         : ""
     }
     Antecedent: ${behavior.antecedent}
     Consequence: ${behavior.consequence}
     Notes: ${behavior.notes}`
    )
    .join("\n\n");
};

const formatReinforcersForPrompt = (reinforcers) => {
  return reinforcers
    .map(
      (reinforcer) =>
        `Type: ${reinforcer.type}
     Specific: ${reinforcer.specific}
     Effectiveness: ${reinforcer.effectiveness}
     Notes: ${reinforcer.notes}`
    )
    .join("\n\n");
};
```

## Mobile Considerations

The RBT user flow accommodates mobile usage patterns:

1. **Responsive Design**:

   - All form elements adapt to smaller screens
   - Single column layout on mobile devices
   - Touch-friendly input controls

2. **Mobile-specific Interactions**:

   - Swipe navigation between form sections
   - Bottom navigation for key actions
   - Collapsible sections to manage screen space

3. **Offline Capabilities**:
   - Data cached locally if connection lost
   - Form completion possible offline
   - Automatic sync when connection restored
