# PraxisNote: RBT Daily Report Assistant App

## Feature Overview

PraxisNote is a specialized application designed to help Registered Behavior Technicians (RBTs) efficiently document and manage daily session data for clients. The app's primary purpose is to streamline the data collection process, facilitate input from Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs), and automatically generate comprehensive daily reports for each client session.

The app addresses the following business problems:

- Manual documentation is time-consuming and prone to errors
- Fragmented collection of data across multiple platforms or paper-based systems
- Inconsistent reporting formats and standards
- Difficult collaboration between RBTs and BCBAs
- Challenges in tracking client progress over time

By providing a unified digital platform, PraxisNote adds value through:

- Time savings for healthcare professionals
- Improved data accuracy and consistency
- Enhanced collaboration between team members
- Better insights into client progress
- Compliance with documentation requirements

## Architecture Overview

PraxisNote will be built as a full-stack Next.js application with a structured, component-based architecture following modern web development practices. The architecture is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and responsive.

### High-Level Architecture

```
PraxisNote
├── Frontend (Next.js App Router)
│   ├── UI Components (React + ShadCN + TailwindCSS)
│   ├── Form Logic and Validation (React Hook Form + Zod)
│   ├── State Management (React Context + Hooks)
│   ├── Report Generation Logic
│   └── Authentication (Next-Auth)
├── Backend (Next.js API Routes)
│   ├── Data Access Layer (Drizzle ORM)
│   ├── Business Logic
│   ├── Authentication & Authorization
│   └── API Endpoints
└── Database (PostgreSQL via Supabase)
    ├── Users & Authentication
    ├── Clients
    ├── Session Reports
    ├── Behavior Programs
    └── Analytics Data
```

The application follows a clean architecture pattern where:

- UI components are separated from business logic
- Data access is abstracted through an ORM layer
- API endpoints provide a clear contract between front and backend
- Authentication secures all user data and actions

## Key Components and Modules

### 1. User Authentication Module

- Responsible for user registration, login, and session management
- Implements role-based access control (RBT, BCBA, Administrator)
- Integrates with Next-Auth for secure authentication

### 2. Client Management Module

- Handles client profiles, demographics, and history
- Manages client-therapist relationships
- Maintains client program/treatment plans

### 3. Session Report Module

- Core module for data entry and report generation
- Implements structured forms for all required session data
- Provides real-time validation and error handling
- Generates formatted reports from collected data

### 4. Dashboard and Analytics Module

- Visualizes client progress over time
- Provides insights on treatment effectiveness
- Offers filtering and search capabilities for past sessions

### 5. Notification and Reminder System

- Alerts users about pending tasks
- Reminds RBTs of upcoming sessions
- Notifies BCBAs of reports requiring review

### 6. Data Export and Integration Module

- Exports reports in various formats (PDF, CSV)
- Potentially integrates with other healthcare systems

## Implementation Details

### Data Models

Key data models include:

1. **User**

   - Authentication details
   - Professional role (RBT, BCBA)
   - Profile information

2. **Client**

   - Personal information
   - Treatment program references
   - Assigned professionals

3. **SessionReport**

   - Basic session information
   - References to program data
   - Behavior documentation
   - Notes and recommendations

4. **Program**

   - Skill acquisition programs
   - Target behaviors
   - Measurement criteria

5. **BehaviorLog**
   - Behavior records
   - Frequency, duration, intensity
   - Antecedents and consequences

### Database Schema

The PostgreSQL database schema will use relations such as:

- One-to-many: User to SessionReports
- Many-to-many: Clients to Users (through assignments)
- One-to-many: Client to Behaviors
- One-to-many: SessionReport to BehaviorLogs

### API Endpoints

Core API endpoints will include:

```
/api/auth/* - Authentication endpoints
/api/clients - Client management
/api/clients/:id - Single client operations
/api/reports - Report management
/api/reports/:id - Single report operations
/api/programs - Program management
/api/analytics - Data analysis endpoints
```

### Form Implementation

For the Daily Session Entry form, we'll implement a multi-step form process with dynamic fields. The form will use React Hook Form with Zod schema validation to ensure data integrity.

## Code Samples

### Session Form Component Structure

```tsx
// app/reports/new/page.tsx
import { SessionForm } from "@/components/session/SessionForm";

export default function NewReportPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto py-6">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">New Session Report</h1>
      <SessionForm />
    </div>
  );
}

// components/session/SessionForm.tsx
import { Form } from "@/components/ui/form";
import { SessionInfoSection } from "./sections/SessionInfoSection";
import { SkillAcquisitionSection } from "./sections/SkillAcquisitionSection";
import { BehaviorSection } from "./sections/BehaviorSection";
import { ReinforcementSection } from "./sections/ReinforcementSection";
import { NotesSection } from "./sections/NotesSection";
import { AnalystSection } from "./sections/AnalystSection";

export function SessionForm() {
  // Form initialization and submission logic here
  return (
    <Form {...form}>
      <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
        <div className="space-y-8">
          <SessionInfoSection />
          <SkillAcquisitionSection />
          <BehaviorSection />
          <ReinforcementSection />
          <NotesSection />
          <AnalystSection />
          <Button type="submit">Generate Report</Button>
        </div>
      </form>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

### Dropdown Initial Values

Based on industry standards and common ABA therapy practices, here are the initial values for dropdown elements:

```tsx
// lib/constants/form-options.ts
export const LOCATIONS = [
  { value: "home", label: "Home" },
  { value: "clinic", label: "Clinic" },
  { value: "school", label: "School" },
  { value: "community", label: "Community Setting" },
  { value: "telehealth", label: "Telehealth" },
  { value: "other", label: "Other" },

```

## Integration and Testing Strategy

### Integration Approach

- Implement core UI components and forms first
- Build database schema and migration scripts
- Develop API endpoints with mock data
- Connect frontend to backend APIs
- Add authentication and authorization
- Implement report generation
- Add analytics and dashboard features

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions
  - UI components with React Testing Library
  - API handlers with Jest
  - Utility functions
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
  - Form submission flows
  - API integration
  - Database operations
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user journeys
  - User registration and login
  - Creating and submitting reports
  - Viewing and editing past reports
- **Accessibility Testing**: Ensure the application is accessible to all users

## Impact on Existing Architecture

As this is a new implementation, there isn't an existing architecture to impact. However, the design decisions made now will affect future scalability and maintenance:

- The component-based architecture allows for easy extension
- The database schema is designed to accommodate future features
- API endpoints are RESTful and can be expanded as needed
- Authentication system supports multiple user roles

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Mobile Application**: Develop a native mobile app for on-the-go data entry
2. **Offline Support**: Add offline data collection with synchronization
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Implement more sophisticated data visualization and analysis
4. **Integration with EHR Systems**: Connect with electronic health record systems
5. **Customizable Forms**: Allow organizations to customize the data collection forms
6. **AI-Assisted Reporting**: Implement AI to suggest report content based on past entries

### Maintenance and Evolution

- Regular security audits and updates
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- User feedback collection and feature prioritization
- Database optimization as data grows
- Continued accessibility improvements
