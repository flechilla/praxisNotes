# PraxisNote Accessibility Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the accessibility requirements and implementation guidelines for the PraxisNote application. Ensuring accessibility is essential not only for compliance with regulations but also to provide equal access to all users regardless of their abilities.

## Accessibility Standards Compliance

PraxisNote will be developed to meet or exceed the following accessibility standards:

- **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA**
- **Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (US)**
- **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements**

## User Accessibility Needs

The application must accommodate users with various disabilities, including:

### Visual Impairments

- Blindness
- Low vision
- Color blindness
- Light sensitivity

### Auditory Impairments

- Deafness
- Hard of hearing

### Motor Impairments

- Limited fine motor control
- Tremors
- Paralysis
- Fatigue disorders

### Cognitive Impairments

- Learning disabilities
- Attention disorders
- Memory impairments
- Autism spectrum disorders

## Specific Accessibility Requirements

### Keyboard Accessibility

- All interactive elements must be operable using a keyboard alone
- Logical tab order following the visual flow of the page
- Visible focus indicators with sufficient contrast
- No keyboard traps or areas where keyboard focus cannot escape
- Support for standard keyboard shortcuts
- Skip navigation links for bypassing repetitive content

```typescript
// Example implementation of skip link
<a
  href="#main-content"
  className="sr-only focus:not-sr-only focus:absolute focus:p-2 focus:bg-white focus:z-50"
>
  Skip to main content
</a>
```

### Screen Reader Compatibility

- Semantic HTML structure with appropriate heading hierarchy
- Proper ARIA landmarks (main, nav, aside, etc.)
- Text alternatives for all non-text content
- ARIA labels for elements without visible text
- Descriptive link text that makes sense out of context
- Notification of dynamic content changes
- Form controls with associated labels

```html
<!-- Example of proper form labeling -->
<div className="form-group">
  <label id="client-name-label" htmlFor="client-name">Client Name</label>
  <input
    type="text"
    id="client-name"
    aria-labelledby="client-name-label client-name-desc"
    required
  />
  <p id="client-name-desc" className="help-text">
    Enter the client's full legal name
  </p>
</div>
```

### Color and Contrast

- Text color contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against backgrounds (Level AA)
- No information conveyed by color alone
- Contrast ratio of 3:1 for large text (18pt or 14pt bold)
- User interface components and graphical objects with sufficient contrast
- Visual indication of focus and hover states beyond color changes

### Text and Typography

- Text resizable up to 200% without loss of content or functionality
- No use of justified text which can create uneven spacing
- Line height of at least 1.5 within paragraphs
- Paragraph spacing at least 1.5 times larger than line spacing
- Letter spacing of at least 0.12 times the font size
- Word spacing of at least 0.16 times the font size

### Content Structure

- Consistent navigation and interface components across pages
- Multiple ways to access content (navigation, search, sitemap)
- Clear page titles that describe page purpose
- Section headings to organize content
- Lists used appropriately for grouped items
- Tables used for tabular data with proper headers

### Forms and Input

- Clear error identification beyond color indicators
- Descriptive error messages with instructions for correction
- Form validation that provides guidance rather than just errors
- Sufficient time to complete forms with option to extend
- Support for autocomplete to reduce input burden
- No automatic submission on selection

```tsx
// Example error handling with proper accessibility
<FormField
  control={form.control}
  name="sessionDate"
  render={({ field, formState }) => (
    <div className="form-group">
      <Label htmlFor="sessionDate">Session Date</Label>
      <Input
        id="sessionDate"
        type="date"
        aria-invalid={!!formState.errors.sessionDate}
        aria-describedby={
          formState.errors.sessionDate
            ? "sessionDate-error"
            : "sessionDate-desc"
        }
        {...field}
      />
      <p id="sessionDate-desc" className="help-text">
        Enter the date the session occurred
      </p>
      {formState.errors.sessionDate && (
        <p id="sessionDate-error" className="error-text" role="alert">
          {formState.errors.sessionDate.message}
        </p>
      )}
    </div>
  )}
/>
```

### Multimedia

- Captions for all pre-recorded audio content
- Audio descriptions for pre-recorded video content
- Transcripts for audio-only content
- Media players with accessible controls
- No auto-playing media
- User control over animation and movement

### Time-Based Content

- No content that flashes more than three times per second
- Ability to pause, stop, or hide moving content
- No session timeouts without warning and option to extend
- Adequate time provided for reading and interaction

### Mobile and Touch Accessibility

- Touch targets at least 44 by 44 pixels
- Sufficient spacing between touch targets
- Support for screen orientation changes
- Gesture alternatives for complex actions
- No reliance on hover or motion for operation

## Testing Requirements

Accessibility testing will be performed at multiple stages:

1. **Development Testing**

   - Automated testing with tools like Axe, Lighthouse, and WAVE
   - Keyboard-only navigation testing
   - Color contrast verification

2. **Pre-Release Testing**

   - Screen reader testing with NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver
   - Testing with actual assistive technology users
   - Cognitive walkthrough with focus on simplified tasks

3. **Production Monitoring**
   - Periodic automated scans
   - User feedback collection specific to accessibility
   - Regression testing after major updates

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Practices

- Use semantic HTML5 elements wherever possible
- Implement accessible design patterns from WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices
- Ensure all interactive JavaScript components are accessible
- Add ARIA attributes only when necessary, preferring native HTML solutions
- Test accessibility during development, not just at the end

### Component-Specific Requirements

#### Navigation Components

- Consistent navigation patterns across all pages
- Current page indication in navigation
- Breadcrumbs for complex nested pages
- Mobile navigation that is fully accessible

#### Form Components

- Logical grouping with fieldsets and legends where appropriate
- Required fields clearly indicated in multiple ways
- Clear instructions before form elements
- Informative error messages at point of error
- Success confirmation that is announced to screen readers

#### Data Tables

- Proper table structure with `<th>` for headers
- Caption or summary for context
- Column and row headers identified
- Complex tables with appropriate ARIA attributes
- Responsive design that maintains relationships on small screens

#### Modal Dialogs

- Proper focus management (focus moves to modal, stays trapped until closed)
- ESC key to close
- Proper ARIA roles (dialog/alertdialog)
- Focus returns to triggering element when closed

```tsx
// Example of accessible modal implementation
const Modal = ({ isOpen, onClose, title, children }) => {
  const modalRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const closeOnEsc = (e) => {
      if (e.key === "Escape") onClose();
    };

    if (isOpen) {
      document.addEventListener("keydown", closeOnEsc);
      // Focus trap implementation would go here
    }

    return () => {
      document.removeEventListener("keydown", closeOnEsc);
    };
  }, [isOpen, onClose]);

  if (!isOpen) return null;

  return (
    <div className="modal-overlay" onClick={onClose}>
      <div
        ref={modalRef}
        className="modal-content"
        role="dialog"
        aria-modal="true"
        aria-labelledby="modal-title"
        onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}
      >
        <h2 id="modal-title">{title}</h2>
        <div>{children}</div>
        <button
          className="close-button"
          onClick={onClose}
          aria-label="Close modal"
        >
          Ã—
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Custom Form Controls

- Must maintain accessibility of native controls
- Keyboard operable with standard keys
- Proper ARIA roles, states, and properties
- Visible focus and selection states

#### Data Visualization

- Alternative text descriptions for charts and graphs
- Data tables as alternatives to complex visualizations
- Multiple ways to distinguish data (pattern, shape, color)
- Interactive elements that are keyboard accessible

## Responsive and Adaptive Features

- Content readable without horizontal scrolling at 320px width
- Text spacing adjustable without breaking layouts
- Zoom support up to 400% without loss of functionality
- Reflow of content to maintain readability at different sizes
- User preference support (reduced motion, high contrast)

```css
/* Example media query for responsive design */
@media (max-width: 640px) {
  .form-layout {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
  }

  .form-field {
    width: 100%;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
  }
}

/* Example of prefers-reduced-motion support */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.001s !important;
    transition-duration: 0.001s !important;
  }
}
```
