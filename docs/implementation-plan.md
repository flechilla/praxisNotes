# PraxisNote Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for the PraxisNote application, with a focus on delivering an MVP that allows Registered Behavior Technicians (RBTs) to complete session forms and generate reports.

## MVP Scope

The Minimum Viable Product will focus on:
