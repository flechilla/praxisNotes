# Workflows, Pre-commit Hooks, and Testing Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps needed to improve the development workflow by:

1. Setting up GitHub workflows for CI/CD
2. Implementing pre-commit hooks with Husky
3. Creating a validate script to check lint, format, and build
4. Establishing a unit testing framework for the project

## Current State

The project is a monorepo using Turborepo with the following structure:

- Apps: web and docs
- Packages: ui, eslint-config, tailwind-config, typescript-config

The project currently has basic scripts for build, dev, lint, check-types, and format, but lacks:

- Automated CI/CD workflows
- Pre-commit validation
- Unit testing infrastructure

## Implementation Checklist

### 1. GitHub Workflows Setup

- [ ] Create a `.github/workflows` directory
- [ ] Create a CI workflow (`ci.yml`) that runs on pull requests and pushes to main
  - Will run linting, type checking, and build
- [ ] Create a release workflow (`release.yml`) that runs on version tags
  - Will build and potentially publish packages

### 2. Husky and Pre-commit Hooks

- [ ] Install Husky and required dependencies
- [ ] Configure Husky for the project
- [ ] Set up `lint-staged` for running checks on staged files
- [ ] Create pre-commit hooks to run linting, type checking, and formatting on changed files

### 3. Validate Script

- [ ] Update package.json to add a validate script that combines:
  - Linting
  - Type checking
  - Formatting check
  - Build validation
- [ ] Configure Turborepo to support the validate command

### 4. Unit Testing Framework

- [ ] Select appropriate testing libraries (Jest, Vitest, or React Testing Library)
- [ ] Install testing dependencies at the root and in relevant packages
- [ ] Create test configuration files
- [ ] Set up example tests for different types of components/modules
- [ ] Configure test coverage reporting
- [ ] Add test scripts to package.json
- [ ] Update CI workflow to run tests

## Files to Modify

### Root Level Files

1. `package.json`

   - Add new scripts for validate, test, and prepare (for Husky)
   - Add new devDependencies

2. `turbo.json`
   - Add validate and test tasks
   - Configure dependencies between tasks

### New Files to Create

1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
2. `.github/workflows/release.yml`
3. `.husky/pre-commit`
4. `.husky/commit-msg` (optional, for commit message validation)
5. `jest.config.js` or `vitest.config.ts` (at appropriate levels)
6. `.lintstagedrc.js`

### Existing Files That May Need Updates

1. Applications and packages may need testing configuration and example tests
2. ESLint configuration to include test files

## Implementation Details

### GitHub Workflows

The CI workflow will:

- Install dependencies
- Run linting
- Check types
- Run tests
- Build the projects
- Potentially run E2E tests (future enhancement)

The release workflow will:

- Build the packages
- Create release artifacts
- Potentially publish to npm or other deployment targets

### Husky Configuration

Will set up Husky to:

- Run lint-staged on pre-commit
- Validate commit messages if we adopt a commit convention
- Ensure that code quality checks pass before allowing commits

### Testing Strategy

We will implement:

- Unit tests for utilities and isolated components
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- Integration tests for key user flows
- Set up mocking for external dependencies and APIs

### Future Considerations

- Add E2E testing with Playwright or Cypress
- Implement visual regression testing
- Add performance benchmarking
- Set up accessibility testing

## Next Steps

1. Start by installing the necessary dependencies
2. Create GitHub workflows first to establish CI
3. Implement Husky pre-commit hooks
4. Add the validate script functionality
5. Set up the testing framework
6. Add example tests
7. Update documentation to reflect the new workflow
