# Report Generation Form Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to improve the user flow for report generation in the PraxisNotes application. The goal is to streamline the data entry process by providing predefined values and improving the UI/UX.

## Current Implementation

We've already implemented:

- Dropdown options for Skill Programs and their corresponding Target Skills
- Dropdown options for Behavior Names and Definitions
- Loading indicators for asynchronous data fetching
- Improved table layouts for added items
- Enhanced form layout and styling
- API endpoints for skills and behaviors data
- Client-side API modules to fetch predefined values
- Error handling for API failures with retry functionality

## Future Improvements

### Short-term Tasks

- [x] **Replace mock data with actual API endpoints**

  - ✅ Create API endpoints for skills and behaviors in `/api/skills` and `/api/behaviors`
  - ✅ Modify the frontend to use these endpoints instead of mock data
  - ✅ Add proper error handling and fallbacks

- [ ] **Add search functionality to dropdowns**

  - Implement search/filter capabilities for program and behavior dropdowns
  - Support partial text matching for easier selection
  - Add autocomplete suggestions

- [ ] **Save user preferences**
  - Store frequently used skills and behaviors per user
  - Add a "Favorites" section for quick access to common options

### Medium-term Tasks

- [ ] **Implement form state persistence**

  - Save form progress to localStorage or backend
  - Allow users to resume incomplete forms
  - Add auto-save functionality

- [ ] **Add bulk operations**

  - Allow adding multiple skills or behaviors at once
  - Support importing data from previous sessions
  - Enable copying entries from templates

- [ ] **Improve validation and error handling**
  - Add more detailed validation feedback
  - Implement inline validation for immediate feedback
  - Add form section completion indicators

### Long-term Tasks

- [ ] **Create a database schema for predefined values**

  - Design proper tables for storing skills, behaviors, and their relationships
  - Implement admin interface for managing predefined values
  - Add versioning support for tracking changes to definitions

- [ ] **Add analytics for form usage**

  - Track most commonly used skills and behaviors
  - Monitor time spent on each form section
  - Generate insights to continually improve the form

- [ ] **Implement AI-assisted form completion**
  - Suggest relevant skills based on client history
  - Auto-generate report sections based on entered data
  - Provide contextual help during form completion

## Files to Modify

- `apps/web/app/rbt/report/form/SkillAcquisition.tsx`
- `apps/web/app/rbt/report/form/BehaviorTracking.tsx`
- `apps/web/lib/types/SessionForm.ts`
- ✅ Create new API endpoints:
  - ✅ `apps/web/app/api/skills/route.ts`
  - ✅ `apps/web/app/api/behaviors/route.ts`
- ✅ Create client-side API modules:
  - ✅ `apps/web/lib/api/skillsApi.ts`
  - ✅ `apps/web/lib/api/behaviorsApi.ts`
- Database models (when implementing actual database)

## Technical Approach

1. ✅ Replace the mock data functions with real API calls
2. Implement proper database models for skills and behaviors
3. Add pagination and search functionality to handle large datasets
4. Enhance the UI components to support more complex interactions
5. Implement form state management for a better user experience

## Success Metrics

- Reduced time to complete form sections
- Increased consistency in data entry
- Positive feedback from RBT users
- Decreased occurrence of form validation errors
