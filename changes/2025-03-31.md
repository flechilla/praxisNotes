## Completed Database Schema with Proper Relations and PostgreSQL Enums - 11:30 pm

- Implemented relationships between all tables using Drizzle's relations API
- Converted all string-based predefined values to proper PostgreSQL enums:
  - `sessionStatusEnum` for tracking session and report statuses
  - `intensityLevelEnum` for behavior intensity levels
  - `reinforcementTypeEnum` for reinforcement types
  - `effectivenessLevelEnum` for reinforcement effectiveness
  - `promptLevelEnum` for skill prompting methods
- Updated type definitions and validation schemas to match the new enum types
- Ensured consistent data values and improved type safety across the entire database schema
- Configured proper cascade deletes for parent-child relationships
- Verified successful build and validation of the database package

## Enhanced Database Schema with PostgreSQL Enums - 11:15 pm

- Added `reinforcementTypeEnum` for reinforcement types (e.g., "Token Economy", "Social Praise")
- Implemented `effectivenessLevelEnum` for rating reinforcement effectiveness
- Created `promptLevelEnum` for skill prompting methods (e.g., "Verbal", "Gestural")
- Updated related Zod validation schemas to use enum validation
- Improved type safety and consistency across related tables
- Standardized data values to prevent inconsistent entries
