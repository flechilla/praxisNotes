## API Database Integration Progress - Behaviors API - 1:45 PM

- Created the Behaviors database table schema (`packages/database/src/schema/behavior.table.ts`)
- Added seed data for behaviors (`packages/database/src/seed/behaviors.ts`)
- Updated the Behaviors API route to support database integration (currently using mock data with database implementation ready)
- Added proper error handling for API requests
- Updated response types according to the API response structure
- Prepared the database schema for behaviors table

Next steps:

1. Update the database schema index to export the behaviors table
2. Create migration for the behaviors table
3. Complete the database integration for the other API routes
4. Update the API routes to use the database once schema is complete

## Behaviors API Full Database Integration - 2:30 PM

- Updated the Behaviors API route to directly use the database layer
- Migrated the implementation from mock data to database queries
- Changed search mechanism to use SQL-like searching with Drizzle ORM
- Fixed imports to directly reference the behaviors table schema
- Marked the Behaviors API implementation as complete in the plan

The Behaviors API now fully uses the database layer for all operations including:

- Retrieving all behaviors
- Finding a behavior by ID
- Searching behaviors by name or definition
